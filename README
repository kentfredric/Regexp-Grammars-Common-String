Regexp::Grammars::Common::String

Regexp::Grammars is just too useful to not use, but too pesky and
confusing for new people.

Some of the more complex things involve string extraction and
escape-handling, and I seriously spent the better part 2 hours learning
how to make this work. So, even if this module is not immediately
useful, it may serve as an educational tool for others.

I probably should have delved deeper into the Regexp::Common Family, but
I couldn't find one in there that did exactly what I wanted.

At present, this module only provides one rule, "String", but I will
probably add a few more later.
