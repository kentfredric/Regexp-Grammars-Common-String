Regexp::Grammars::Common::String - Some basic String parsing Rules for Regexp::Grammars

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01000002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Regex::Grammars;
    use Regexp::Grammars::Common::String;

    my $re = qr{

        (.*<[String]>)+

        <extends: Regexp::Grammars::Common::String>

    }x; #  don't forget the x!

        ...

    if( $content =~ $re ){
        print Dumper( \%/ ); # Praying Mantis operator!?
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Regexp::Grammars|Regexp::Grammars> is just too useful to not use, but too pesky and confusing for new people.

Some of the more complex things involve string extraction and escape-handling, and I seriously spent the better part 2 hours learning how to make this work. So, even if this module is not immediately useful, it may serve as an educational tool for others.

I probably should have delved deeper into the L<Regexp::Common|Regexp::Common> Family, but I couldn't find one in there that did exactly what I wanted.

At present, this module only provides one rule, L</String>, but I will probably add a few more later.

=head1 RULES

=head2 String

For parsing strings like so:

    "Hello"     => 'Hello'
    "Hel\lo"    => 'Hello'
    "Hel\\lo"   => 'Hel\lo'
    "Hel\"lo"   => 'Hel"lo'

It should do a reasonable job of picking up strings from files and properly returning their parsed contents.

It made sense to me to drop the excess C<\>'s that are used for escaping, in order to get a copy of the string as
it would be seen to anything else that parsed it properly and evaluated the escapes into characters.
